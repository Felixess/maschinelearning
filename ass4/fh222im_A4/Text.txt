Exercise 3.1
	It is hard to see since I did use pritty similar datasets. But I think that PCA and t-SNE is 
	really good and wellstructured pictures. But the separation of classes can vary depending on 
	the complexity of the data and the inherent patterns present. Some classes may be 
	well-separated and distinct, making them easier to distinguish using any of the techniques. 

Exercise 3.2
	Hierarchical clustering is effective in capturing hierarchical structures and nested clusters. 
	It can handle various cluster shapes and sizes. Classic k-Means and Bisecting k-Means are often 
	efficient for large datasets and when clusters have a spherical shape.

	Some clusters may be well-separated and distinct, making them easier to separate using any of 
	the clustering techniques. Other clusters may exhibit overlap or complex relationships, making 
	their separation more challenging.

	Well-separated clusters with distinct boundaries are easier to separate, while clusters with 
	significant overlap or complex relationships require more advanced techniques or additional 
	preprocessing steps to achieve effective separation.
